# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

In this project I did a series of analyses on mock kickstarter data for a client looking to launch a campgaign for a play.

Below are some of the key findings.

The US is home to kickstarter and as such has far more kickstarter campaigns than any other country. Here we can see that kickstarter campaigns in the theater category succeeded more often than not although there is still a fairly high rate of failed campaigns.

Zeroing in on plays in particular, we see that they actually fair a little better than the other sub-categories in the theater category.

It looks like there's a good chance the client can launch a successful campaign, but how can we make that more likely?

It's clear from the data that May is the ideal month to launch the campaign and I'd recommend the client chooses May to launch their campaign.
